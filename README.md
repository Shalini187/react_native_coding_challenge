Coding Challenge

Introduction

We would like you to conceptualize and develop a simple website to track and compare SpaceX launches. On https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ you will find all available resources and a fully functional GraphQL explorer to play with. For the website we would like you to work with the following GraphQL query:

See code in Attachment.

 
Tasks

● Visualize the GraphQL query response: The user should be able to access all information in some form.

● Provide filters to search by mission and rocket name.

● Provide some form of pagination (endless scroll or traditional pagination).

● The user should be able to select two launch entries and click on a button “Compare” to see the results for these two launches next to each other (on a new page or in a dialog).

● Please add a README file to the project, where you describe your thoughts on how you visualized the launches, what you would have done if you had more time and where you encountered problems.

● The README should also contain some instructions on how to run the project.


Project Guidelines

● This project will be used to evaluate your coding and software design skills. We are interested in the programming patterns that you use, the quality of the code and your sense for a good UI / UX.

● You can choose whatever UI framework you prefer. Starting the project with a boilerplate is expected, however we are interested in your code and less about the project structure and tooling.

● Please provide a link to a GitHub repository to check on your project.


Stack Requirements

● React Native 0.69+

● Typescript

● TailwindCSS
